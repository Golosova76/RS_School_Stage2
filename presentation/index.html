        <p>SVG Introduction</p>
        <div>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.
          Key advantages of SVG include scalability without loss of quality, the ability to be programmatically controlled via JavaScript, and accessibility for search engines.
