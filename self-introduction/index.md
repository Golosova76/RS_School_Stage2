3. This world, where you can create and develop projects that simplify everyday processes and make them more interesting, has always seemed fascinating to me.
4. After obtaining a degree in Applied Informatics in 2011, personal circumstances forced me to move into the financial sector.
5. During my time in finance, I went from a junior accountant to the chief accountant, taking a leadership position.
6. This experience has developed my management skills my ability to work in a team and under pressure and my ability to analyze large amounts of information and make important decisions.
7. My dream of programming never left me, and in 2023, I was finally able to start realizing it by enrolling in a frontend development course at RS School.
8. Since then, from the preparatory course to the present day, as I finish stage 1, every step has been an important milestone on the way to fulfilling my dream.
9. On the latest project at RS School, I developed the Nonogram game, using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the Vite builder for project assembly.
10. Special attention was paid to setting up tools to improve code quality and optimize the workflow, including Eslint and Prettier, which allowed me to maintain a high standard of coding and ensure its cleanliness and readability.
11. One of the key reasons I chose frontend development is the ability to see immediate results of my work.
12. I like the idea of creating convenient and beautiful user interfaces that make interaction with software not only functional but also enjoyable.
13. In the near future, I plan to focus more deeply on studying and applying native JavaScript, explained by its limitless possibilities and flexibility.
14. In the world of web development, where new frameworks and libraries constantly appear, the basics of JavaScript remain vitally important and relevant.
15. My personal qualities, such as attention to detail, the ability to learn quickly, and the ability to work in a team, play an important role in my professional activity.
16. I believe that these qualities will help me not only adapt to new technologies and projects but also effectively interact with colleagues and clients.
